## Project Structure

The project is divided into several main folders and files:

- **lib/**
    - **components/:** Contains reusable widgets, such as the task difficulty widget.
    - **data/:** Contains data access logic, including DAOs and database configuration.
    - **models/:** Defines the data models for the app, such as `UserModel` and `TaskModel`.
    - **screens/:** Contains all the app screens.
